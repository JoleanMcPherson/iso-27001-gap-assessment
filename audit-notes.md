## 🔍 Observations

- Several security controls are informally practiced but not formally documented.
- Responsibilities for security activities are often embedded in IT/Operations but lack oversight from GRC/compliance functions.
- Lack of evidence documentation may pose challenges during external ISO audits.

## 📌 Recommendations

- Document existing practices formally (e.g., roles, policies, asset inventory).
- Introduce evidence collection procedures for all control activities.
- Use a GRC tool or spreadsheet to maintain version-controlled compliance records.
- Prepare for stage 1 audit by addressing top risks noted in remediation plan.
