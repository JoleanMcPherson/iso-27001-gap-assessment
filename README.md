# 📊 ISO 27001:2022 Control Gap Assessment

This mock audit project simulates an internal ISO 27001:2022 control gap assessment for a fictional SaaS company. It identifies missing or partially implemented controls, compares them against Annex A, and documents remediation recommendations.

## 🧩 Scenario
The fictional organization, “SecureFlow,” is preparing for ISO 27001 certification. You are brought in as an internal consultant to perform a readiness assessment based on the 2022 version of the standard.

## 📌 Objectives
- Review current security policies, procedures, and technical controls.
- Identify ISO 27001 Annex A controls that are missing or incomplete.
- Provide gap assessment results and risk-based remediation recommendations.
- Demonstrate practical GRC skills for audit prep and compliance tracking.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- ISO 27001:2022 Annex A Control Set
- Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets (for Gap Matrix)
- Markdown documentation (for reporting)
- GitHub (for version control and transparency)

## 📄 Project Structure
